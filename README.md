# Tri-themed-Game-Jam
 Another game submission from Team Sabog.
 
## What is this?
*(Untitled Game)* is a game focusing on the three themes that were given in the Tri-themed Game Jam of DLSU; which are **Fortress**, **Replication**, and **You Only Get One**. The objective of the game is to survive the 1 week you are given by gathering resources, making good use to your soldiers, and hopefully defend yourself efficiently to the wave of replicating monsters that's about to be unleashed upon you.
