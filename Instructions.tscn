You are given some soldiers who will do your bidding. Those soldiers can be ordered to capture villages or towers, capturing towers will grant the resources wood and steel, while capturing villages will grant you food access and soldiers.

Obtaining resources:
Once there are soldiers in the villages or towers the resources arenâ€™t immediately given to you and there is a button to deliver resources back. When the resources are safely safe inside the fortress you can use them for upgrades which can give you the edge in this endless wave of enemies

Click Mechanic:
Enemies are charging at you and one way to deal with them is to click using your left mouse button! When the soldiers are in the fortress they will also attack the enemies and help fend of the endless horde.

Happy Surviving!"
